\title{Calculate Distance between two SimHash fingerprint}
\usage{
getDistance(s1, s2)
}
\arguments{
\item{s1}{character, the first fingerprint}

\item{s2}{character, the second fingerprint}
}
\value{
return the distance as a nmeric value
}
\description{
A function that calculate the distance between two given fingerprint a _charachter_, distance is equal to 0 means the two strings are similar 100%.

 dist1<-getDistance(getsimHash(text1,64),getsimHash(text2,64))
 #dist1 is equal to 7, means the two strings are near-duplicate.

 dist2<-getDistance(getsimHash(text1,64),getsimHash(text3,64))
 #dist2 is equal to 21, means the two strings are not similar.
