#' Calculate Distance between two SimHash fingerprint
#'
#' A function that calculate the distance between two given fingerprint a _charachter_, distance is equal to 0 means the two strings are similar 100%.
#' @param s1 character, the first fingerprint
#' @param s2 character, the second fingerprint
#'
#' @return
#' return the distance as a nmeric value
